## My process

Before starting coding the project, I always begin by sketching the project in my notebook. Then, I made a basic HTML form layout for the parcel ordering form. After that, I created a new React application using Node.js modules in VSCode's terminal. I converted the HTML form to JSX in App.js and built a React component "ParcelShippingForm" for data manipulation. Once the React component was complete, I added a simple, user-friendly, and responsive design to the shipping form in the CSS file.

### Built with

- Desktop-first workflow
- [React](https://reactjs.org/) - JS library
- JSX
- Node.js (https://nodejs.org)
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
